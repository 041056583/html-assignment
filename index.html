      <p>
        My name is Darby, I am from a <em>small town</em> in British Columbia. I
        moved to Ontario in 2018 to begin my career in the the military. I then
        finished my 3 year contract in 2021, and then decided to move to Ottawa
        to begin a new educational journey.

        I like to be outdoors, camping, fishing, climbing and more!. I am
        excited to be part of this program as a 1<sup>st</sup> year student.
